## Project 3 - Machine Learning

This work aims to build a Fuzzy or Machine Learning system to solve a problem chosen by the group. The job is
to find a suitable solution to the chosen problem. The project must contain:
- What problem is being investigated
- A description of the technique (for example, the network architecture) employed
- The results achieved associated with a discussion on the same
- Implementation specifics and restrictions
- The list of responsibilities and the level of participation of each member of the group in the final project

The system must be evaluated according to the quality of the solutions found and a critical evaluation is expected on
the relationship between the choices made x quality of the solution. Graphs and tables representing the results of the
solutions are expected. Additional comparisons with the literature are welcome, although they are not mandatory. If
the group is using an existing implementation, this information needs to be clearly presented in the text.
